# Training-Convolutional-Network-with-Partial-Noise-MNIST
Training CNN with noise allows the network to generalize to different situmulus in classification and prediction tasks.
This notebook demonstrates that only small percentage of noisy data in the dataset is required to achieve optimal testing accuracy on noisy images. 
In this notebook, you can customize the ratio of noisy-pure images and the intensity of noise. 
Additionally, visual graphs are added to understant model's performance and accuracy. 
This notebook is part of a paper which will be presented in IEEE conference.
